# LOGICDATA

## CTFs
#### You need to install a Logic analyzer to capture the flag. [Click here](https://www.saleae.com/downloads/) to download

### I. challenge1.logicdata :-

1. Download the Logicdata file from [here](https://github.com/RanitPradhan/LOGICDATA/blob/master/challenge1.logicdata?raw=true)

2. Open the `challenge1.logicdata` file and follow the steps

3. We can see different channels are there but we need only 'Channel 0'

4. We need to take one annotation here. We can take two different annotations but no need to take for this problem.

5. If we zoom in at the first annotation

7. Looks like a measurement for 1 bit, based on this measure we could get the baud rate(aka bit rate).
   1000000 รท 8.66 = 115473.441109
   This number is very close to 115200, a known baud rate. We can setup the bit rate in the Async Serial analyzer.

8. And we get the following:
